"""Phase nodes and routers for the booking graph.

A phase node is the bridge between the outer graph's structured state and the inner ReAct
agent. It reads ``BookingState``, builds the phase's system prompt, runs the inner agent,
parses the ``STATUS:`` token from the answer, and writes the outcome back to state. A
matching router then turns that outcome into the name of the next node.

Only Phase 1 lives here today; the ``StateGraph`` that wires these nodes (plus interrupts
and phases 2-6) is a later slice. See docs/phase-based-booking-architecture.md.
